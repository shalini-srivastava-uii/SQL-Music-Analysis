# SQL_Project_Music_Store_Analysis
SQL project to analyze online music store data

Analyzing an online music store's data using SQL in a PostgreSQL database involves querying and processing various aspects of the data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, sales patterns, inventory management, and other business metrics. Here is a general description of how you might approach this analysis:

Database Schema:

The first step in analyzing the data is understanding its structure. A typical online music store database might have tables representing entities such as:

Customers: Information about the store's customers, including their names, addresses, emails, and other demographic details.
Orders: Details about customer transactions, including order IDs, customer IDs, order dates, and total amounts.
Products: Information about the music products available for sale, including track names, artists, genres, prices, and stock levels.
Genres/Artists/Albums: Additional tables to store information about genres, artists, and albums.
Order Items: Associating products with specific orders, including quantities and prices.
Payments: Details about payment transactions, including payment IDs, order IDs, payment methods, and amounts.
SQL Queries and Analysis:

Sales Analysis:

Total revenue over a specific period.
Top-selling products, genres, or artists.
Sales trends over time (daily, monthly, yearly).
Customer purchase history.

sql----

SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
Customer Behavior:

New vs. returning customers.
Customer location analysis.
Customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis.

sql----

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS new_customers
FROM orders
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) = 2023
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM orders
    WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) < 2023
    AND customer_id = orders.customer_id
);
Inventory Management:

Products low in stock.
Products not sold within a specific period.


sql----

SELECT product_name, stock_level
FROM products
WHERE stock_level < 10;
Marketing Analysis:

Effectiveness of marketing campaigns.
Conversion rates for different products or genres.

sql----

SELECT COUNT(order_id) / COUNT(DISTINCT visitor_id) AS conversion_rate
FROM orders o
JOIN sessions s ON o.session_id = s.session_id
WHERE s.marketing_campaign = 'SummerSale2023';
Customer Feedback Analysis:

Analyzing customer reviews and ratings.
Identifying popular and unpopular products based on reviews.


sql----

SELECT product_name, AVG(rating) AS average_rating
FROM products p
LEFT JOIN product_reviews pr ON p.product_id = pr.product_id
GROUP BY product_name
ORDER BY average_rating DESC;
